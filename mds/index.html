M. Tech in Data Science is a masters degree programme offered by the Centre of Research and Education in Data Science (CREDS) at IIT Palakkad.  A major highlight is that it is interdisciplinary in nature with four engineering streams (CSE, EE, CE, ME) and three science streams (Physics, Math, Humanities & Social Science) participating in the program. <br><br>
<hcc> Starting with the July 2020 Semester.</hcc>

<br><br>
<h3> Breadth and Depth of the Curriculum </h3>
The curriculum is developed by leading data scientists in the country making it relevant for the current and future requirements of Data Science in industry as well as academic research. Faculty of CREDS comprises of young yet experienced researchers in various fields of data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, information theory and several application areas like climatology, traffic engineering, fluid mechanics, data security, econometrics, linguistic, material science etc. <br>

<br> The curriculum contains core and elective courses along with a project spread over four semesters. Core courses will help to develop fundamentals of data science which will include subjects such as <hbl>Probability-Statistics, Linear Algebra, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Optimization, Deep Learning, Big data analytics</hbl>. Whereas electives will cover subjects such as reinforcement learning, econometrics, and various inter disciplinary subjects. All courses will be offered by the experts in the field and associated with the subject at the front line of the global research. 
<br><br>

Students will work on a year long  research or development project with the state-of-the-art computational and experimental facilities which will likely lead to publications, patents, products, or software. To achieve expertise in both fields, students will be encouraged to do project on application of data science in their areas of expertise. 

<br><br>
The students will get the opportunity to learn data science in a vibrant ecosystem around the area and actively contributing to the front line research. 
There will be ample opportunities for the graduates of this program after the program whether it be a PhD at overseas top universities or a job within or outside the country.  <br>

<br>
<h3> Who can apply </h3>
Students from various backgrounds can join the program. They will go through foundational training in the first semester, with more depth and breadth in various application areas in the following semesters through electives.  <br><br>

<hcc>Details about admission will be announced soon on the institute webpages. </hcc>
